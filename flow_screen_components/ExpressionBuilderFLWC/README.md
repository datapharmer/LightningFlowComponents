Work In Progress

This is an LWC screen component. It is intended to become a Flow Screen Component in Winter '20.

The goal of this is to provide a basic expression builder that takes as an input either a formula string or a set of metadata representing an expression (candidates are the metadata that expressions are stored as in flow xml and the metadata that is used in other parts of Salesforce)
